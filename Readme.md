### Agile

#### What is a squad?

You and your fellow squad members are on the same long-term mission and spend your days in each other's company. This self-organiz$ing entity possesses all the skills and tools needed to cover the entire workflow, from design to release.

A squad consists of 4 up to 8 people. Its composition is typically based on specific needs and can evolve over time, depending on the experise and capacity that is required. Every squad must be formally approved by higher management.

There are several types of squads each with their own mission and objectives. Although there is no actual hierarchy in squads (apart from the operational authority), all squad members have a well-defined key role, according to expertise and type of squad. Each of these roles comes with its own specific responsibilities. However, it is up to every member to see to it that the squad is successful, no matter which part they fulfill. Taking ownership is a general responsibilities.
